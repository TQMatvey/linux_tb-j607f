	bool "Power Sequencer drivers"
	help
	  Provides support for special power sequencing drivers. Power
	  sequencer is an entity providing abstraced power on/power off/reset
	  operations for the connected devices. Possible usages include MMC
	  SDIO devices, some complex WiFi/BT chips, controlled USB hubs, etc.

	  Say Y here to enable support for such devices.

if PWRSEQ

config PWRSEQ_QCA
	tristate "Power Sequencer for Qualcomm WiFi + BT SoCs"
	depends on OF
	help
	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for Qualcomm
	  WCN399x,QCA639x,QCA67xx families of hybrid WiFi and Bluetooth SoCs.
	  Note, this driver supports only power control for these SoC, you
	  still have to enable individual Bluetooth and WiFi drivers. This
	  driver is only necessary on ARM platforms with these chips. PCIe
	  cards handle power sequencing on their own.

	  Say M here if you want to include support for Qualcomm WiFi+BT SoCs
	  as a module. This will build a module called "pwrseq_qca".
